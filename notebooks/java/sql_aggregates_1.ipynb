    "# Execution Model for Processing Aggregates\n",
    " \n",
    "Processing aggregates in Aerospike involves processing a stream of records through a pipeline of operators on server as well as client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four types of operators are supported: Filter, Map, Aggregate, and Reduce. The operators work with one of the following data types as input and output: Record, Integer, String, Map (the data type, not to be confused with the Map operator), and List. Only the initial filter(s) and first non-filter operator in the pipeline can consume Record type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filter: Object -> Boolean; filters input objects, input and output objects are of the same type.\n",
    "- Map: Object -> Object; any transformation is possible.\n",
    "- Aggregate: (Current State, Object) -> New State; maintains the global \"aggregate\" state of the stream. While any type can be used, a (Aerospike) Map type is often used.\n",
    "- Reduce: (Object, Object) -> Object; reduces two objects to a single object of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operators may appear any number of times and in any order in the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operator pipeline is typically processed in two phases: first phase on server nodes and the second phase on client.\n",
    "- Phase 1: Server nodes execute all operators up to and including the first reduce operation in the pipeline.\n",
    "- Phase 2: The client processes results from multiple nodes through the remaining pipeline operators starting with and including the first reduce operation in the pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the first reduce operation if specified in the pipeline is executed on all server nodes as well as on client. If there is no reduce operator in the pipeline, the application will receive the combined results returned from server nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Post aggregation processing involves operators after the first reduce in the pipeline, usually for sorting, filtering, and final transformation, and takes place on the client side. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation processing in Aerospike is defined using User Defined Functions (UDFs). UDFs are written in Lua with arbitrary logic and are executed on both server and client as explained above. Since aggregates by definition involve multiple records, only stream UDFs are discussed below (versus record UDFs whose scope of execution is a single record). \n",
    "\n",
    "A stream UDF specifies the pipeline of operators for processing aggregates. Different aggregates differ in their UDF functions, whereas the Aerospike APIs are the same to specify the aggregate processing. \n",
    "\n",
