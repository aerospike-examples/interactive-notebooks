The application can check the completion status of the task, and after it is completed may examine the results in the database with one or more separate requests. \n",

    "# Asynchronous Operations For Better Resource Efficiency\n",
    "During the time a request is sent to the server and the result arrives (“request latency”), the client and application need not wait idly if a high throughput is the goal. A higher throughput can be achieved through concurrent requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Synchronous: The application can spawn multiple threads and process multiple requests in parallel, one per thread at a time. \n",
    "- Asynchronous: The application can process requests asynchronously by submitting them in parallel without waiting for the results. The results are processed as they arrive in a different “callback” thread. An async request uses a dedicated connection to the server.\n",
    "- Pipeline: Multiple requests could be sent over the same connection to the same server node, and their results received over the same connection. Thus there is greater sharing of threads and connections across multiple requests. Aerospike currently does not support pipeline processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, asynchronous processing can be more resource efficient and can deliver better throughput than multi-threaded synchronous processing because threads have memory and CPU (context-switch) overhead and their number may be limited by the OS. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the asynchronous model is more complex to program and debug. The application should make judicious use of synchronous, asynchronous, and background requests. The client can perform different type of commands in a single instance. \n",

    "# Understanding Event Loops\n",
    "Let's look at the key concepts relating to event loops. As described above, an event loop represents concurrent submit-callback processing of requests. See the code in [Async Framework](#Async-Framework) section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Number of event loops**: In order to maximize parallelism of the client hardware, as many event loops are created as the number of cores dedicated for the Aerospike application. An event pool is aligned with a CPU core, not to a server node or a request type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concurrency level**: The maximum concurrency level in each event loop depends on the effective server throughput seen by the client, and in aggregate may not exceed it. A larger value would result in request timeouts and other failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connection pools and event loops**: Connection pools are allocated on a per node basis, and are independent of event pools. When an async request needs to connect to a node, it uses a connection from the node’s connection pool only for the duration of the request and then releases it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connection pool size**: Concurrency across all loops must be supported by the number of connections in the connection pool. The connection pool per node should be set equal to or greater than the total number of outstanding requests across all event loops (because all requests may go to the same node in the extreme case). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Delay queue buffer**: To buffer a temporary mismatch in processing and submission rates, there is a delay queue buffer in front of an event loop where requests are held until an async request slot becomes available in the event loop. The queued request is automatically assigned to a slot and processed without involvement of the application. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Throttling**: The delay queue cannot buffer a long running mismatch in submission and processing speeds, however, and if the wait queue fills up, a request will not be accepted and the client will return “delay queue full” error. The application should throttle by keeping track of outstanding requests and issue a new request when an outstanding one finishes. If delay queue size is set to zero, throttling must also be handled in the application code."

    "[Netty](https://netty.io/) is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for high-performance servers based on Java Non-blocking IO ([NIO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_I/O_(Java))) package. [Epoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoll) (event poll)is a Linux specific construct and allows for a process to monitor multiple file descriptors and get notifications when I/O is possible on them. \n",

It presented the programming framework in which async requests can be submitted and handled. It illustrated with code how event loops, throttling, inline async calls are implemented. The trade-offs that a developer needs to make for which execution modes to employ - synchronous, asynchronous, or background - involve multiple factors including the nature of operations, client and server setup, throughput needs, and programming complexity."
