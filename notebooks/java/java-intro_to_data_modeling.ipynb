Because each type of data in a data model has different read/write profile demands, it is common to divide further. For example, data for an ecommerce app might store the hottest sales items in RAM, where the rest are stored in Flash. In such a circumstance, the application may store some identical data in 2 namespaces – 1 associating a subset of products with RAM storage and 1 associating the full product data set with Flash storage.  \n",

Within the index, each record has a 64-byte footprint per record. The weight of this footprint suggests that most Aerospike records should be larger than a simple data type field. However, for the rare case of extremely high throughput access, the index can contain a single numeric element instead of the data record’s location."

    "\n",
    "*It can be helpful to store data as-if different different objects in separate Bins.* \n",
    "\n",
    "*When applying transaction operations on a record using* `Operate()`*, the Aerospike client delivers the return values from operations per Bin. These return values can be accessed in order, making transaction results easier to work with when data is put in separate Bins.*\n",

    "\n",
    "*When data is large, taking advantage of an intrinsic property of the data, like a timestamp, can help to distribute data in an intuitive way across records. Including timestamp in a set name or user key name, for example, allows more efficient reads and writes. It will also allow graceful rotation of data.*"

    "\n",
    "Data modeling with Aerospike is a science, but deep enough that it will seem like an art at first. An intuitive matching of your application object model with Aerospike's data model will generally result in a successful application. \n",
    "\n",
    "When pushing the envelope of performance, do not hesitate to use additional resources. A great way to learn more about modeling is to, post questions to the [data modeling discussion forum](https://discuss.aerospike.com/c/how-developers-are-using-aerospike/data-modeling/143). This is especially worthwhile to optimize Aerospike performance for an application. In addition, discussing requirements with Aerospike's Solutions Architect team will *still* result in performance improvements and increase your ROI using Aerospike.\n",
