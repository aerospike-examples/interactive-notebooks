Through implementation of the StellarStation hardware unit, satellite operators can share their antennas through a cloud-based platform during otherwise idle time, allowing increased transmission at much lower cost, while also passing on revenue to antenna owners in the network.\n\nLowering costs and increasing access will lower barriers for new businesses entering the satellite industry, as well as solve two major problems for existing satellite operators: namely, (1) insufficient satellite access time and (2) unused antenna idle time. The process is simple: Users can share their antenna\u2019s idling time and receive credits, then use those credits to access other antennas around the globe. Alternatively, users can exchange credits for cash.",

While vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) itself is not new \u2013 after all, quadcopters, tilt rotors and tilt wings are well-known concepts \u2013 we did not want to accept the compromises inherent to these configurations.\n\nQuadcopters excel with their simplicity but are highly inefficient in cruise flight. Transition aircraft can fly three times faster and ten times further with an equally sized battery, but system complexity is usually much higher.\n\nSo, the goal was set: defining a transition aircraft concept with better performance in safety, noise, speed, range and payload than existing concepts, while cutting complexity to one third.\n\nWe challenged physical limitations, mechanical complexity and energy laws, until we came up with something new and unique. Something simple and efficient.",

Fast-moving startups have increased innovation and lowered costs in unprecedented ways. But no private company has ventured on its own into the largest potential market, deep space. \n\nAt Deep Space Industries, we are building a new type of spacecraft that drives down the cost of access to deep space as much as 50x lower than current solutions. Our spacecraft gives private companies and government agencies low-cost access to high-Earth orbits, Lunar orbits, near Earth asteroids, Venus, and even Mars, helping to unlock commercial opportunities in the largest segment of the space market. \n\nIn pushing the limits of technology to new frontiers, we intend to help unlock watershed insights and new resources throughout the inner solar system. Our initial focus will be powering scientific, exploratory, commercial, and government missions using our Xplorer spacecraft. As commercial space activities proliferate, we will employ our technology to conduct asteroid science and exploration, support activities such as manufacturing in space, and enter other lucrative vertical markets.",

Our strength comes from our distinct but interrelated functions:\n\nUniversities: we support university-based research, innovation and skills development in astronomy, particle physics, nuclear physics, and space science\nScientific Facilities: we provide access to world-leading, large-scale facilities across a range of physical and life sciences, enabling research, innovation and skills training in these areas\nNational Campuses: we work with partners to build National Science and Innovation Campuses based around our National Laboratories to promote academic and industrial collaboration and translation of our research to market through direct interaction with industry\nInspiring and Involving: we help ensure a future pipeline of skilled and enthusiastic young people by using the excitement of our sciences to encourage wider take-up of STEM subjects in school and future life (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)\nWe support an academic community of around 1,700 in particle physics, nuclear physics, and astronomy including space science, who work at more than 50 universities and research institutes in the UK, Europe, Japan and the United States, including a rolling cohort of more than 900 PhD students.\n\nSTFC-funded universities produce physics postgraduates with outstanding high-end scientific, analytic and technical skills who on graduation enjoy almost full employment. Roughly half of our PhD students continue in research, sustaining national capability and creating the bedrock of the UK\u2019s scientific excellence. The remainder - much valued for their numerical, problem solving and project management skills - choose equally important industrial, commercial or government careers.\n\nOur large-scale scientific facilities in the UK and Europe are used by more than 3,500 users each year, carrying out more than 2,000 experiments and generating around 900 publications. The facilities provide a range of research techniques using neutrons, muons, lasers and x-rays, and high performance computing and complex analysis of large data sets.\n\nThey are used by scientists across a huge variety of science disciplines ranging from the physical and heritage sciences to medicine, biosciences, the environment, energy, and more. These facilities provide a massive productivity boost for UK science, as well as unique capabilities for UK industry.\n\nOur two Campuses are based around our Rutherford Appleton Laboratory at Harwell in Oxfordshire, and our Daresbury Laboratory in Cheshire \u2013 each of which offers a different cluster of technological expertise that underpins and ties together diverse research fields. \n\nThe combination of access to world-class research facilities and scientists, office and laboratory space, business support, and an environment which encourages innovation has proven a compelling combination, attracting start-ups, SMEs and large blue chips such as IBM and Unilever.\n\nWe think our science is awesome \u2013 and we know students, teachers and parents think so too. That\u2019s why we run an extensive Public Engagement and science communication programme, ranging from loans to schools of Moon Rocks, funding support for academics to inspire more young people, embedding public engagement in our funded grant programme, and running a series of lectures, travelling exhibitions and visits to our sites across the year.\n\nNinety per cent of physics undergraduates say that they were attracted to the course by our sciences, and applications for physics courses are up \u2013 despite an overall decline in university enrolment.",

These disruptions include in the first place inherently safe hybrid rocket propulsion systems with advanced paraffin-based fuels. Our launcher therefore will use \"green propulsion\"\u200b without toxicity and environmental harms. Other important disruptive technologies include COTS components for avionics, state of the art production technology for light weight composite structures, 3D printing of various parts, and decreasing cost by serial production. For example, our main engine will be used several times on the launcher. Our first product in development is a single stage sounding rocket using a hybrid rocket engine to deliver institutional and commercial experiments into a micro gravity environment during a suborbital flight. Based on that technology demonstrator, a mini launcher with a target payload of 400 kg into a Low Earth Orbit will be developed.",

Basis for all activities is the knowledge and application of general and higher orbital mechanics. The main research consists of the orbital dynamics of all objects on Earth orbits (space debris), orbit survey and orbit prediction, especially for light satellites and the re-entry of hazardous objects. The Space Debris workgroup belongs to the leading experts in the field of Space Debris modelling. These research activities are applied in several domains:Space Debris Modelling<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Modelling of individual sources: explosion- and collision fragments, solid\u00a0 rocket motor dust and slag, NaK coolant droplets, ejecta, paint and MLI degradation, micrometeoroids<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simulation of fragmentation events: estimation and prediction of time-invariant and spatial distribution of objects on arbitrary orbitsSpace Debris long term analyses<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Projecting the evolution of the future space debris environment<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analyses of Space Debris mitigation techniques on the future environment<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analyses of cascade effects due to collisions<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact of large constellations and small satellites on the long-term evolutionSpace Debris cost-benefit-analysis<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Safety precautions for active satellites<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economics of debris mitigation techniquesSpace Debris risk analyses<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Particle flux analyses on satellite surfaces<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analyses of penetration- and failure-probabilitySpace Debris observation<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Design of optical sensors and radars (monostatic, bistatic, phased array)<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Scheduling of measurement campaignsSpace Surveillance and Tracking System simulation<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simulation of observation campaigns<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Performance analysis of single sensors and sensor networks<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simulating cataloguing of space debris objects with different orbit determination methods, sensors, etc.Space technology education:<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lectures, exercises, laboratories: Fundamentals of space technology, perturbated orbits, satellite techniques, space debris, manned spaceflight, mentoring and supervision of graduating students (MA/BA theses)<br/>The activities are accompanied by re-entry predictions of hazardous objects and simulating observations of Near Earth Objects.<br/>Members of the Space Debris workgroup are delegates for the German Aerospace Center to the Inter Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC).\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br/><b><a href=\"http://space-systems.eu/index.php/en/science/satellite-technology\"><b></b></a><b><a href=\"http://space-systems.eu/index.php/en/science/spaceflight-technology\">W</a><a href=\"https://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/workgroup.html\">orkgroup</a></b> Satellite Technology</b></p><p>The workgroup satellite technology was founded in the course of the restructuring of the Institute of Space Systems. The Satellite Technology group examines the active removal of space debris. The main research areas include:</p><ul><li>Orbit and attitude control of spacecraft</li><li>Docking with non-cooperative targets</li><li>Development, testing and operation of small satellites</li><li>Development of novel docking mechanisms</li></ul><p>In the long term, the group plans the development of small satellites for on-orbit testing and verification of research results. For this purpose, the necessary infrastructure consisting of a satellite integration room and a ground station for communication is being established.New mission concepts for the implementation of &#34;Active Debris Removal&#34; are designed. In particular, uncooperative targets such as tumbling rocket upper stages are considered. These are to be stabilized via the docking of a servicer and thus prepared for a controlled re-entry. The focus here lies particularly on the multibody dynamics and attitude control in space.A docking mechanism for the servicer is under development on the basis of biologically inspired materials. Mechanisms based on adhesive bionic materials which mimic the properties of gecko feet are investigated.To validate the docking mechanism, as well as navigation techniques, a test environment is set up consisting of an air-bearing table, a robotic arm and several testing bodies (simulated experimental satellites). It is noteworthy that the experimental satellites do not require separate supply of compressed gas and thus long-term simulations are possible.\u00a0</p><div><br/></div><div><a href=\"http://space-systems.eu/index.php/en/science/ag-new-systems-and-technology\"><b><b></b></b></a><b><b><a href=\"http://space-systems.eu/index.php/en/science/spaceflight-technology\">W</a><a href=\"https://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/workgroup.html\">orkgroup</a></b> New Systems and Technology</b>\u00a0</div><div>The workgroup \u201eNew Systems and Technologies\u201d studies manned and unmanned exploration of space beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Current focus is on the development of key technologies to support the construction of a future international lunar base and the utilization of space near the Moon.The main research areas of the group are:<ul><li>Propulsion systems for small satellites and space probes: Investigation and development of innovative propulsion concepts for cost-effective and flexible CubeSat missions beyond Low Earth Orbit. These propulsion systems shall allow high velocity changes, for example for self-propelled trajectories to the Moon or adjustments of orbital parameters.</li><li>Utilization of local resources: In-Space Resource Utilization (ISRU), such as processing the regolith of the lunar surface, enables substantial reductions of transport costs and a more flexible expansion of infrastructures on other planetary bodies without supply from Earth. The group develops processes and technologies, such as methods for additive manufacturing of structures from local mineral raw materials and for utilization of other resources, such as metals and water.</li><li>Lunar Science: The Moon itself represents a study subject for space sciences, but due to its unique features it is also an ideal location for scientific instruments and experiments such as telescopes. For these purposes, the group develops concepts for high-performance and cost effective science missions. The mission concepts build upon results from ISRU and propulsion research at the Institute of Space Systems.</li></ul>The activities are integrated into the work of the institute`s other groups and into national and international research projects. That participation allows to take part in the creation of the global space exploration roadmap and the identification of state-of-the art research topics. \u00a0\u00a0<p></p></div>",

In the granular details of daily life, it\u2019s easy to forget that we live in a place of astonishing grandeur and mystery.The Breakthrough Initiatives are a program of scientific and technological exploration, probing the big questions of life in the Universe: Are we alone? Are there habitable worlds in our galactic neighborhood? Can we make the great leap to the stars? And can we think and act\u00a0together\u00a0\u2013 as one world in the cosmos?<br /><b>Where is everybody?</b>So wondered the great physicist Enrico Fermi. The Universe is ancient and immense. Life, he reasoned, has had plenty of time to get started \u2013 and get smart. But we see no evidence of anything alive or intelligent in space. In the last five years, we have discovered that planets in the habitable zone of stars are common. Based on the numbers discovered so far, there are estimated to be billions more in our galaxy alone. Yet we are still in the dark about life. Are we really alone? Or are there others out there?It\u2019s one of the biggest questions. And only science can answer it.<strong><br /></strong><strong>Breakthrough Listen</strong>\u00a0is a $100 million program of astronomical observations in search of evidence of intelligent life beyond Earth. It is by far the most comprehensive, intensive and sensitive search ever undertaken for artificial radio and optical signals. A complete survey of the 1,000,000 nearest stars, the plane and center of our galaxy, and the 100 nearest galaxies. All data will be open to the public.<strong>Breakthrough Message</strong>\u00a0is a $1 million competition to design a message representing Earth, life and humanity that could potentially be understood by another civilization. The aim is to encourage humanity to think together as one world, and to spark public debate about the ethics of sending messages beyond Earth.<br />",

During this war, Belgium experienced indeed the urgent necessity of having its own optical industry, capable of providing the Belgian Armed Forces with spare parts and optical instruments, as well as repairing optical systems, e.g. military binoculars. <br /><br />During the '20ies to '50ies OIP established an excellent reputation as a high-tech optical manufacturer, developing and manufacturing some outstanding quality optics and fine mechanics. Some examples are : lenses and objectives for military applications, high precision microscopes for medical and scientific applications, photo cameras and photocopy machines for the industry. This reputation of excellence soon crossed the borders and OIP became a world leader reknown for its high-tech and its innovative products. <br /><br />From the '60ies on OIP played a pioneering role in the emerging electro-optics technology (the combination of electronics and optics) as one of the first companies in Europe. With a personnel of about 400 people, OIP developed and manufactured some world premi\u00e8res such as the first \"Optical Sight\"\u200b or Head-Up Display for fighter aircraft (NATO F-104 Starfighter) and the first Fire Control Systems for Main Battle Tanks (LEOPARD 1 in Belgium, Canada and Australia in collaboration with SABCA). <br /><br />Important investments were also realised in developing new technologies, such as fibre optics, laser technology, light intensification and holography, as well for military as for industrial applications. <br /><br />Since the '80ies OIP was granted substantial contracts for series delivery of Fire Control systems for export markets and holographic night vision goggles a.o. for the Belgian Army. OIP participated in space projects with a.o. the development of CPU (Critical Point Facility): a sophisticated opto-electronic minilab for scientific experiments in space and Proba-V: an earth-observation satellite, The Proba-V-instrument started its mission in 2013 to observe the global vegetation and is still working accurately. After the development of 2 instruments for the Exomars2016-mission OIP takes part in the search for life on Mars. And in the future the composition of the higher earth atmosphere will be studied thoroughly with the ALTIUS spectrometer. <br />",

L'attivit\u00e0 di ricerca costituisce, inoltre, un percorso parallelo a quello della cooperazione e delle alleanze con il sistema industriale.<br/><br/><br/>Conoscere il mondo dove si andr\u00e0 a operare \u00e8 requisito indispensabile per la formazione degli studenti. Rapportarsi alle esigenze del mondo produttivo, industriale e della pubblica amministrazione, aiuta la ricerca a percorrere terreni nuovi e a confrontarsi con la necessit\u00e0 di una costante e rapida innovazione. L'alleanza con il mondo industriale, in molti casi favorita dalla <a href=\"http://www.fondazionepolitecnico.it/\">Fondazione Politecnico</a> e da <a href=\"https://www.polimi.it/il-politecnico/strutture/enti-partecipati/\">consorzi partecipati dal Politecnico</a>, consente all'Ateneo di assecondare la vocazione dei territori in cui opera e di essere da stimolo per il loro sviluppo.<br/><br/><br/>La sfida che si gioca oggi proietta questa tradizione di forte radicamento territoriale oltre i confini del paese, in un confronto che si sviluppa prima di tutto a livello europeo con l'obiettivo di contribuire alla creazione di un &#34;mercato unico&#34; della formazione. Il Politecnico partecipa a numerosi progetti di ricerca e di formazione collaborando con le pi\u00f9 qualificate universit\u00e0 europee e internazionali, dal Nord America al Sud-Est Asiatico all'Est Europeo. Oggi la spinta all\u2019internazionalizzazione vede il Politecnico di Milano partecipare al <a href=\"https://www.polimi.it/il-politecnico/partnership-internazionali/\">network europeo e mondiale delle principali universit\u00e0 tecniche</a> e offrire numerosi programmi di scambio e di doppia laurea e diversi corsi di studio interamente in inglese.<br/></p>",

I got in touch with DLR when I was still a student. I started by undertaking a student research project on the aerodynamics and aeroelasticity of sounding rockets at the Mobile Rocket Base MORABA, where I subsequently became an intern. I am now responsible for a rocket test rig, where I test transpiration cooling systems for supersonic combustion ramjets. The spacecraft themselves are fully reusable. I enjoy my work and like the family-like atmosphere at the Institute of Space Propulsion. We all get along very well and can completely rely on each other, especially in dangerous test settings.\n\nThe working conditions at DLR are excellent\u2026\nand I feel it is my duty to contribute. I was a doctoral candidate representative for three years and am currently a company paramedic. At the site in Lampoldshausen we have our own medical and fire service, because we work with highly flammable fuels.",
