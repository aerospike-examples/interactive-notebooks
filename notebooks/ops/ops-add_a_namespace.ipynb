    "This tutorial on Aerospike Operations demonstrates how to add a [Namespace](https://docs.aerospike.com/docs/operations/configure/namespace/index.html) to an Aerospike Cluster while maintaining real time application performance. Using [AWS Quickstart](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ouzvxjdgfsa64) and [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) facilitates infrastructure creation. The notebook will also help a new Aerospike administrator learn cluster administration basics.\n",

    "# Scenario for Namespace Addition\n",
    "An application adds a new major feature, which requires the addition of a new in-memory namespace named ```newns```. During this process an original 3-node (m5.large) cluster is replaced with a new (m5.xlarge) cluster. This example assumes the use of Aerospike’s mesh network. In a real world situation, this would be an ideal time to resize existing namespaces, as needed."

Since the default replication factor for a 1-node Aerospike database is 2, this process can be used with most single-node Aerospike databases.
