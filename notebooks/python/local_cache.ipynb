    "Caches are ubiquitous. Aerospike is commonly and effectively deployed as a cache in front of a backend database that is remote, slow, and/or limited in throughput. This notebook illustrates use of a local cache on the client machine that sits in front of the Aerospike database, with specific scenarios when it can be beneficial. The pattern is applicable for a standalone Aerospike database as well as when Aerospike itself acts as a cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cache provides faster access and improved throughput by having a copy of the data closer to where it is processed. Cache libraries, external caching servers, and distributed cache infrastructure are deployed for specific caching needs and solutions. Aerospike CacheDB is designed for fast, reliable, consistent, and cost-effective access across the globally distributed data infrastructure.\n",

    "# Cache Design\n",
    "\n",
    "We will illustrate a local cache fronting the Aerospike database. The key benefit of a local cache stems from its proximity hence speed advantage: Aerospike provides average access time of a millisecond or less for 99%+ requests, while local memory cache access can be in microsecond range. Even so, as we will see, limitations of memory size need to be taken into account as do cost consideration since a local cache needs to be implemented at each client host.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let us define a simple interface for the local cache."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Cache Interface\n",
    "The cache consists of cache entries with the following key operations:\n",
    "- get(key)\n",
    "    - Get from cache if available and TTL is not expired, else retrieve from the database and add to the cache.\n",
    "- update(key, data)\n",
    "    - Update the database by replacing the current record, and also add or replace the cache entry.\n",
    "- add(key, entry)\n",
    "    - If the cache is full, evict appropriate entry and add the cache entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cache Eviction\n",
    "A local cache can be implemented with TTL based garbage collection. Another alternative is to maintain a Least-Recently-Used (LRU) list and remove LRU entry when the cache is full to make room for a new entry. LRU can be implemented by maintaining a doubly linked list of cache entries - below, the classes CacheEntry and LocalCache allude to LRU links, but the implementation is not provided here.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simplistic eviction scheme below for illustrative purpose selects an arbitrary entry for eviction, using dict.popitem(), although better randomized eviction is possible with implementations like [randomdict](https://github.com/robtandy/randomdict). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with Aerospike TTL\n",
    "Aerospike has TTL based eviction that allows for: \n",
    "1. No eviction or the record is permanent, \n",
    "1. At record creation a specific TTL is set, \n",
    "1. TTL may be updated any time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the TTL can change at origin while the record resides in the local cache, the cache will sync up with the origin at the time of caching. This is no different from if the record is deleted at the origin."
