    "## Introduction\n",
    "In Aerospike, the transactional boundaries are \"single request, single record\". While multiple operations may be specified in a single request on a single record, each such operation can involve a single bin and only certain write operations are allowed. Therefore, neither updates involving multiple bins (e.g, \"a=a+b\") nor general logic (e.g., \"concatenate alternate letters and append\") are possible as server-side operations. Of course, UDFs allow complex logic in a transactional update of a single record, however they are not suitable for all situations for various reasons such as performance and ease. Therefore most updates entail the R-M-W pattern or Reading the record, Modifying bins on the client side, and then Writing the record updates back to the server. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial first demonstrates how read-write operations can result in lost writes in a concurrent multi-client environment. \n",

    "# The Problem of Lost Writes\n",
    "In a concurrent setting, multiple clients may be performaing Read-Modify-Write on the same record in a way that get in each other's way. Since various R-M-W transactions can interleave, a transaction can be lost, if another client updates the record without reading the transaction's update.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this, we make use of a record's \"generation\" or version, that is available as the record metadata, and is automatically incremented on each successful update of the record.\n",
    "\n",
    "The integer bin “gen-times-2” holds the value that is 2 times the value of the current generation of the record. A client first reads the current generation of the record, and then updates the bin value 2 times that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a single client, there are no issues in maintaining the semantics of the bin.  However when there are multiple clients, the interleaving of reads and writes of different transactions can violate the semantics. By updating the bin using an older generation value, it may not be 2 times the current generation, which is the constraint that we want to preserve.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will show how transaction writes are lost in a simple concurrent case by observing whether the relationship between record's current generation and the bin value is maintained. Then we will show how the problem is solved using a conditional write with version check.\n"
